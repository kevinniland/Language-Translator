<h2>Project Statement</h2>

<h2>Aim</h2>
<p>Create a cross platform app using Xamarin and Visual Studio. This should deploy to Android, iOS and Windows (as a Universal Windows Platform application). The application should be designed with a clear purpose that is easily grasped by the user. You need to incorporate the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well-designed UI that is fit for purpose and provides a good user experience.</li>
<li>Uses some form of data storage. Using settings is not enough, this must be either file
storage using a JSON format or a database system (local) to manage the data for the
application. The data that is managed can include settings that you read at start up and
maintain based on the user preferences.</li>
<li>Demonstrates appropriate use of the sensors/hardware available on UWP capable devices
These include accelerometer, gyroscope, location services, sound, network service
(connect to server for data), camera, multi touch gestures, pictures, documents.
It is not necessary to use multiple sensors, but those used should be documented
and justified.</li>
<li>The app must be more than a simple information app.</li>
<li>You need to create a test plan as part of the submission to show how you have tested the
application and tracked any issues that have arisen from this testing process.</li>
</ul>
